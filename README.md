Our solution aims at solving the Catalogue Scoring problem statement. We have creates a mechanism that assigns scores to e-commerce product catalogues based on the following three factors:
1. Compliance - Ensuring the catalogue complies with the applicable laws (e.g.: Labelling and display regulations under various statutes.
2. Correctness - Authenticity of the catalogue (e.g.: appropriate use of branding)
3. Completeness - The Catalogue should provide some minimum attributes such that the buyer can understand the product features clearly.
